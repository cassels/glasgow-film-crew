Every Thursday we meet from 7pm until 9pm in the Cineworld Bar on Renfield St, Glasgow. This is an informal way to introduce yourself to the group and get talking to other members. You can find out what projects are in production or even start your own! These meetings are organised on <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Glasgow-Film-Crew/" target="_blank">meetup.com</a> and can sometimes change depending on circumstances. So please check it out there before starting your adventure. Its free to join!
