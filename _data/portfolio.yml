# 1. Each new entry begins with '- '
# 2. Each line of the entry has a 'key' and a 'value' separated by a colon ':'
#       'title' is the key, 'Project Title' is the value
# 3. You can leave any key out and it won't show in the final page. 
#    I.e. removing 'status' from an entry will remove status from the page

  synopsis: Back Page Press commissioned the GFC to make a video to accompany the release of Moonwalker - Adventures of a Midnight Mountaineer by Alan Rowan. Alan chose to deal with his post-work insomnia by driving to the highlands and climbing munros in the pitch black to reach the summit for the sunrise. 
Setting off at 2AM, the GFC made the trek with Alan to film the walk and the spectacular sunrise at the summit. 
Original Music by Luciano Rossi.
