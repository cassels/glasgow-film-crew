  title: Our Humble Beginnings
  image: /img/about/eiffel.jpg
  description: Soul searching in a foreign land, our founder, Ryan Pasi, stumbled across the Paris Film Crew - a meetup group designed to inspire collaboration. Excited by the idea, he stole the concept, packed his bags and headed home for fame and fortune... Unfortunately his home is Glasgow, where fame and fortune are few and far between.

  title: Musical Time
  image: /img/about/guitar.jpg
  description: It's the 48 hour film festival time again and this time, we were given the much dreaded genre - MUSICAL. In most cases the musical genre is swapped for a 'wild card' but not us - With the GFC's wealth of talented musicians, we pulled off an incredibly ambitious musical performance and walked away with an award once again.
